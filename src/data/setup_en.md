## Requirements

- A Megadrive/Genesis rom of Streets of Rage 1 (W) (REV00). For now, no other versions are supported.
There's no plans for Game Gear/Master System versions at all.

- BizHawk (recommended 2.9.1 since I used it for tests)

## Setup

When genning the patch file will have an extension .apsor1 that you can open in the launcher with `Open Patch` button.
Alternatively, you can open with `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` when double clicking on the patch file.

The SRAM is what will be used to track your progression, Streets of Rage doesn't have SRAM normally so you cannot use vanilla rom to play. The patch file will output a .md file that you can run with BizHawk.

You need to be connected to request to load a stage. Failing to do so will reset you to SEGA logo when you press Start on the round selection.
